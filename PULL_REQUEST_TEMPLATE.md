#### Single-line Summary
**Today, Meryl and Anwar paired together. It took about 2 hours **

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we started on the index.html file and added our script tags.
  2. Next, we added the styling to our navigation bar and used CSS media queries to distinguish between desktop and mobile. 
  3. In article.js, we completed the constructor function for all articles. 
  4. We removed the template class for each article.
  5. For each article we used jQuery to populate each article in our html.
